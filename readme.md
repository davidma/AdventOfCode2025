# Advent of Code 2025

Hohoho - back again with more daily head-bashing, while trying to solve code in a languauge I dont use much, so that I can get better at it.

All the puzzles are at: https://adventofcode.com/2025

As requested, none of the puzzle inputs, or sample inputs are included - I normally store them as **input_test.txt** and **input.txt** in the same folder as the problem code for each day

**Progress on Puzzles**

- Day1:  Both parts, all good
- Day2:  Both parts, all good
- Day3:  Both parts, no issues
- Day4:  Both parts, no issues
- Day5:  Both parts done, last part took a bit of thinking!
- Day6:  Both parts, all good (once I leared how strip() works...)
- Day7:  Both parts, no big issues
- Day8:  All done, but pressed for time, so had a look at the subreddit for general ideas
- Day9:  Both parts, all good. 
- Day10: Part 1 done, had to resort to z3 and someone elses code for part 2
- Day11: Both parts, all good
- Day12: Read problem, panic - read memes, realize its trivial
